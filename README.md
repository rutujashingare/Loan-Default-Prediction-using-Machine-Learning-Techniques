# Loan-Default-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
Assessed the likelihood of loan default based on customer demographics and financial data by fitting a model  using various machine learning techniques and thereby predict defaulting applicants.

Interest on loans and associated fees are some of the biggest revenue sources for most banks and credit unions. Considering the magnitude of risk and financial loss involved, it is essential for banks to give loans to credible applicants who are highly likely to pay back the loan amount.
However, the rate of loan default is increasing exponentially. According to Forbes, nearly 40 percent of borrowers are expected to default on their student loans by 2023. Considering the statistics, instead of making money from loan interest, banks will suffer a huge capital loss. In order to prevent the loss, it is very important to have a system in place which will accurately predict the loan defaulters even before approving the loan.
